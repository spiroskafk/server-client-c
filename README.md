# server-client-c

This is a theatre-reservation system written in c. It uses the server-client model
where we have a bunch of available staff that can create the reservations in the system,
but the number of people that want to make the reservations are always bigger than the staff.

So, in the first project we used proccesses, semaphores, shared memory, signals etc.
And in the second one we used pthreads, mutex, and condition variables
